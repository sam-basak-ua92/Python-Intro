    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It is widely used in many fields, including web development, automation, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. Python is popular in data analytics because it has powerful libraries that help you collect, clean, analyse, and visualise data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reasons Python is great for data analytics:\n",
    "- Easy to read and write, making it ideal for beginners.\n",
    "- Powerful libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib for working with data.\n",
    "- Flexible for automation, reporting, and data visualisation tasks.\n",
    "- Supported by a huge community and open-source tools.\n"

    "## What are if, elif, and else statements?\n",
    "In Python, these statements allow your program to make decisions. They let your code choose between different paths based on whether certain conditions are True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Structure\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code block runs if condition is True\n",
    "elif another_condition:\n",
    "    # code block runs if the above 'if' was False, but this is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block runs if all above conditions are False\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You always start with if\n",
    "- You can include zero or more elif (else-if) parts\n",
    "- else is optional, and it acts as a catch-all if none of the previous conditions were True\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "When Python reaches an if statement:\n",
    "1. It checks the condition after the if\n",
    "2. If the condition is True, it runs the indented code block directly under it and skips the rest\n",
    "3. If it's False, Python moves to the next elif (if present), and repeats the process\n",
    "4. If all conditions are False, it runs the else block (if present)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Them?\n",

    "- You want your code to react differently depending on conditions\n",
    "- You're handling user input, data values, or program state that can vary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to remember\n",
    "- Always indent the code under if, elif, and else. Python uses indentation (usually 4 spaces) to show what code belongs in each block\n",
    "- You don't need to use elif or else if you just want to check one thing\n",
    "- You can have multiple elifs, but only one if and one else"
